# Electric Bus Smart Charging Optimization platform

 Code for a electric smart charging platform, project from my PhD research.
 
 Abstract: The efforts concerning climate change mitigation drive the accelerated deployment of electric buses incities. The transition to electric fleets, however, faces some limitations. Fleets uncoordinated chargingand high charging power requirements may result in major technical problems in power distribution systems, endangering the bus-system feasibility and grid security. In this context, this research proposes developing an adaptive energy management strategy for electric bus fleets – including participation in vehicle to grid schemes – to tackle the aforementioned issues. The methodological approach resides in applying artificial intelligence techniques to cope with the dynamic behaviour of the bus-grid system incombination with state-of-the-art optimization models and methods. It is expected to design aninnovative adaptative optimization framework that would be an eff ective solution to provide decision support in the transport electrification process in a sustainable city context.
